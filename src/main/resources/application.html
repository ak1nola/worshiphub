About:
------

This application is based on real "EpicWorship" application - https://github.com/iyobo/epicworship - which is a awesome application.
Over the last 2 years, I made some UI and java tweaks for my church so as I was learning kotlin, I simply chose the application as my first real kotlin project. So, even though this application covers most of the same ground as EpicWorship, I don't know that I can say it's a true enough replacement.

The one ask that would be nice to have is to incorporate presentation files into the application directly - but that depends on how much time I have.

Psalm 105

Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.... Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.... He remembers his covenant forever... Praise the LORD
